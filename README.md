# DAN.IT - Automated Testing Framework Project

 
## Description
This project involved building a robust automated testing framework. A website was selected for testing, and four pages were chosen for test scenarios. For each page, at least five test cases were written and then implemented in code using the framework.

The framework includes a testng.xml file to seamlessly execute all created tests. Logging was incorporated for improved traceability, and Allure framework integration provides comprehensive test reports.

The end result is a fully functional testing framework capable of running at least 15 test cases. Test cases were documented using various tools such as TestRail. A presentation was prepared to showcase the project, covering both the practical implementation and theoretical aspects, including manual testing, Java theory, and automation principles.
